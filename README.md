## Overview

This is the first public project I have completed. I have been learning HTML and CSS for one week and have a basic grasp of the concepts used to create content and then position and design that content. This project took me about an hour to complete and a little bit of help from Google to find the right tags and attributes to correctly position and design the QR code "card" in the center of the page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While completing this project I was able to implement for the first time HTML and CSS code. I learned how to use containers, and had to investigate and learn to use Flexbox, which was the part that I struggled with most, as it had not be covered in my class yet.


```css
body{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to continue to focus on Flexbox and Grid to be able to better position items on the page and learn to better design my projects. I also want to get more comfortable with HTML flow and heirarchy to improve the readability and logic of my code.
